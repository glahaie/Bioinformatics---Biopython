This file assumes that you have compiled the MAVID package according to the
instructions in the INSTALL file. All of the programs, if run with no
arguments, will explain what they do and give instructions for usage. But
examples are good so we are providing some.


MAVID
----------------------
To align the sequences in the file "seqs", simply run

../mavid/mavid tree seqs

The alignment can be refined using an iterative refinement by using the "-r"
option. For example:

../mavid/mavid -r tree seqs

although in this (simple) example, refinement does not make a difference.


checkfasta
---------------------
If the given file is a valid fasta sequence file, checkfasta prints (and
returns) the number of sequences in it. If not (or if the file is not found),
then it prints (and returns) zero.


cut_alignment
--------------------
Having aligned the file "seqs" as above, try:

../utils/cut_alignment/cut_alignment mavid.mfa 1 2
../utils/cut_alignment/cut_alignment mavid.mfa 1 2 Yak


extract_seq
---------------------
../utils/extract_seq/extract_seq seqs Mel[1,-1] Yak[1,4]
../utils/extract_seq/extract_seq -i seqs Mel[1,-1] Yak[1,4]
../utils/extract_seq/extract_seq seqs Mel[1,-1] Yak[1,4] Yak[5,9]


extract_tree
---------------------
../utils/extract_tree/extract_tree tree Vir Pse Yak
../utils/extract_tree/extract_tree tree Vir Pse Yak Ere


project_alignment
---------------------
Having aligned the file "seqs" as above, try:

../utils/project_alignment/project_alignment mavid.mfa Vir Moj
../utils/project_alignment/project_alignment -so mavid.mfa Yak Pse


randtree
---------------------
Try:

../utils/randtree/randtree seqs
../utils/randtree/randtree seqs
../utils/randtree/randtree seqs


root_tree
---------------------
The root_tree program takes as input an unrooted tree in Newick format
(such as those produced by the clustalw program) and roots the tree at
the midpoint between the two most distant leaves of the tree. For example,

../utils/root_tree/root_tree unrooted_tree

will output the same tree as in the file "tree".


tree_dists
---------------------
../utils/tree_dists/tree_dists tree Vir Moj
../utils/tree_dists/tree_dists tree Ana Mel Yak
../utils/tree_dists/tree_dists tree
