IMPORTANT: If you are using MAVID on Macintosh OS X, you must run the
command "unlimit stacksize" before running the MAVID program.

This package includes the MAVID alignment program together with auxiliary
programs which make it easier to use. If you know the phylogenetic tree for
your sequences, then you just want to use the MAVID program. If you don't
know the phylogenetic tree, then you can use the mavid.pl script to iteratively
align the sequences and estimate a tree for them. More information about each
component is given below. If you use results from MAVID in a paper, please

Installing MAVID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MAVID program is ready to run and its usage is described below. To use
the mavid.pl script, you must have CLUSTALW and fastDNAml installed on your
system and must edit the mavid.pl file to specify the locations of CLUSTALW
and fastDNAml on your system. If you do not have CLUSTALW or fastDNAml, they
can be obtained from the following sites:

http://geta.life.uiuc.edu/~gary/programs/fastDNAml/
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/clustalw/

Please remember to cite these programs if you use results from the mavid.pl
script in a publication.



The MAVID Program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAVID is a program for computing global alignments of multiple homologous
sequences. The usage is as follows:

mavid tree_file sequence_file

where tree_file is a binary, rooted phylogenetic tree in Newick format with
branch lengths and sequence_file is a file containing two or more sequences in
multi-FASTA format. MAVID also requires a repeat masking file
sequence_file.masked which is the .masked file from RepeatMasker.

More information about Newick and multi-FASTA formats, can be found at
these addresses:

http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html
http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/mavid/multifasta.html


The tree file specifies the phylogenetic relationship between the sequences
in the sequence file. A sequence is identified by the first word of its
FASTA line and so the FASTA lines for the different sequences must begin
with different words.

If the "-r" option is used, then after performing an initial alignment, each
sequence is pulled out of the alignment and realigned to the others with the
goal of fixing errors in the alignment. The "-c" option allows the user to
specify a file containing constraints on the alignment, i.e. regions in the
sequences which are already known to correspond to each other. Each line of
the constraint file should be of the form:

<fasta id 1> <start 1> <end 1> <fasta id 2> <start 2> <end 2>

for example, "DroAna 34805 35213 DroMel 50319 50727"

As an example, you can download the files:

http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/mavid/hmr.fasta
http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/mavid/hmr.fasta.masked
http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/mavid/hmr.tree

and run "mavid hmr.tree hmr.fasta".

The output of the program consists of two files:

mavid.phy - the multiple alignment in Phyllip format
mavid.mfa - the multiple alignment in multi-FASTA alignment format.




The mavid.pl Script
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mavid.pl script iteratively aligns a collection of sequences and estimates
a tree for them. To use the script, you must have either fastDNAml or CLUSTALW
installed on your machine. Before running mavid.pl for the first time, you
must edit the mavid.pl file and specify the location of these programs.

Given a sequence file, mavid.pl randomly chooses an initial tree and then
aligns the sequences with MAVID using that tree. From this alignment, a
phylogenetic tree is estimated using either fastDNAml or CLUSTALW. The
sequences are then aligned using the estimated tree and the process is repeated
a given number of times.
