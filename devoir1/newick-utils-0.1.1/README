The Newick Utilities are a suite of programs for working with Newick-formatted
phylogenetic trees.

See INSTALL for installing. Basically, it's the familiar

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install

There are no fancy options. I still use a few nonstandard GNU extensions like
asprintf(), I will work towards removing them if there is demand for this.
